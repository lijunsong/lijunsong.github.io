        <div class="content">
          <div class="left-margin">Most of my starting journey has been documented in <a href="/my-two-years-drawing-journey.html">My Two Years Drawing Journey</a>.</div><p>It is hard for self-taught beginners to systematically learn drawing. That’s why I’ve spent so much time struggling on my drawing journey. If I would give a recommendation of a drawing book to self-taught beginners, <span class="cite-book">Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain</span> is the one, preferably the first drawing book they’ve ever read.</p><p>Few beginners actually realize the hidden influence of symbol interference developed in their childhood. As the influence is prevalent during the drawing process, the earlier beginners know it, the quicker they will be finding ways to their next stage. As for me, once I realized this interference in my mind, I started to observe the world–drawing realistic objects so to speak–literally as it is, in a week.</p><p>In addition to understanding observation, this book also helps beginners build up the habit to measure the proportions and relations of lines and curves. As for me, I had to measure a lot in drawing when I started out this book, but later as I practiced more and more, I could just eyeball these relations. I also learned to use negative space extensively throughout a drawing. It helped me avoid interference too; the more I practiced, the easier it was to observe the negative space, and the less interference there was. Realizing negative space and being able to switch to negative space at my will really open another door for me to this world. I can see more than I used to; reading sky becomes just fun again.</p><p>In a later chapter, this book introduces color harmony. Once I knew the color wheel, I found it extremely useful for understanding some pleasure feelings I had when looking at some objects. I noticed the color of this body wash gave me some feelings, but now I understand why I had that feelings. It is all about the color wheel.</p><p>Which part of the book I value the most?  You can see I’ve learned a lot from the book. I like the way the book presenting symbol interference. I appreciate exercises to do photo copy upside down and blind contour. I also like the idea of using view finders. But I still remember the moment when I re-read the following words after I finished the book and realized that I could draw anything from life from now on:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote>Broadly speaking, except for the degree of complexity, <em>all drawing is the same</em>. One drawing task is no harder than any other.</blockquote></div><p>Confidence is probably the most important thing for any self-taught learning process. This book has shed a light on my drawing journey. I wish you would have a chance to read it someday.</p>
