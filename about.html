            <p>Hi there. This is Junsong Li. Welcome to my blog.</p>
            <p>
              If you have read some of my posts, you may notice that I
              write mainly about technical stuff. That's what I do at
              work and that's where my interests are.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this blog, I try my best to not repeat things easily
              searchable on the web as repeating doesn't add any
              value. If you find I do, that's only because I like
              documenting my exploration to certain problems, and
              these problems may seem to repeat what other people have
              explored. In this case, these posts still try to provide
              unique perspectives.
            </p>

              My main interests in Computer Science are among
              programming language theory (PLT) and large systems. The
              interest in PLT was developed in school, and carried to
              work since then. My favorite languages are OCaml and
              Racket.
            </p>

            <p>
              My current work is on storage services. I worked on
              POSIX storage previously and now on Blob
              storage. Sometimes it feels too much to take care of
              services from the hardware provisioning, to turning up
              services, to monitoring services, to improving service
              cores. Automation helps, only to certain extent. What's
              more important is the designer of the service must be
              aware of how the system could fail and provide solid
              solutions. Working on all stacks of the server lifetime
              and service lifetime has helped me develop a good sense
              of reasons for system failures. I hope it also makes me
              a better system designer.

            <p>What do I do besides work?</p>
            <div class="right-margin"><p>Here is my badge. I wonder when can I finish all problems. <img width="150px" src="https://projecteuler.net/profile/lijunsong.png"/></p></div>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When I feel I am up for some challenges, I work on Project
                Euler.
              </li>
              <li>
                I enjoy drawing and woodworking in my free time.
              </li>
              <li>I read books in both English and Chinese. I
                occasionally <a href="/journal-cn/index.html"> blog
                  about books in Chinese</a> as well.
              </li>
              <li>
                I appreciate good stories. I don't normally play video
                games unless they tell good stories or they have
                innovated mechanics. I do own an Oculus Quest, and I
                like it.
              </li>
